# Route-Dedicator
CISC 204 Project Modelling 1
In terms of structure, our project is pretty straightforward - the only file that code is written in is run.py. We also imported databases for the canadian and american cities. Note: you must be connected to the Internet in order for goepy to work. You also need to use Docker.

To summarize, our project allows the user to pick 2 cities in Canada or the United States to travel between, as well as any from 0-10 stops along the way. A model corresponds to the combination of feasible trips from the start to the destination. The user can also specify if they want to take an urgent trip. Follow the user input and enjoy!

Structure
documents: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
run.py: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
test.py: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
